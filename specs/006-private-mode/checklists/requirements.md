## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. 数据迁移策略：已明确选择选项 A（完全隔离，无数据迁移功能）
   - 更新了 Edge Cases 中的数据隔离说明
   - 在 Out of Scope 中明确排除数据导出/导入功能
   - 添加了 FR-013 和 FR-014 来规范数据隔离行为
   - 在 Assumptions 中添加了用户对数据隔离的接受假设

**Specification is ready for next phase**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
