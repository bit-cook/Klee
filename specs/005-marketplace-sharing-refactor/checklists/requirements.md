# Specification Quality Checklist: 知识库与 Agent 市场分享流程重构

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **VALIDATION PASSED**: All checklist items are complete.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification is written from user perspective without technical jargon
- ✅ No mention of specific frameworks (React, TanStack, Hono) in requirements
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are fully specified
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-057) is testable
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (e.g., "3秒内", "1秒内", "500毫秒")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "用户能在详情页点击分享按钮" instead of "React 组件调用 API")
- ✅ 9 comprehensive user stories with Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified covering performance, concurrency, and data integrity
- ✅ Scope is clear: sharing/unsharing/installing/deleting knowledge bases and agents
- ✅ 12 assumptions documented covering slug generation, caching, transactions, etc.

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each user story (P1/P2) has corresponding functional requirements
- ✅ User scenarios cover all primary flows: share, unshare, install, delete
- ✅ 12 measurable success criteria align with user stories
- ✅ No technical implementation leaked (e.g., no database schema, no API endpoints in requirements)

### Specification Strengths:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 9 user stories covering all aspects of marketplace sharing
2. **Clear Prioritization**: P1 for core features (sharing, installing), P2 for management (unsharing, deleting)
3. **Measurable Outcomes**: All success criteria have specific time/performance targets
4. **Edge Case Analysis**: Identified 8 potential issues including performance, concurrency, and data consistency
5. **Assumption Documentation**: 12 detailed assumptions about implementation constraints
6. **Entity Relationships**: Clear data model with 6 key entities and their relationships

### Ready for Next Phase:

✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications needed
✅ All requirements are actionable and unambiguous
✅ Success criteria provide clear validation targets
