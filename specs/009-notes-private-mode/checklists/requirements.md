# Specification Quality Checklist: Notes Private Mode

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Check ✅

**Status**: PASSED

The specification maintains a clean separation between business requirements and implementation:
- Uses business language (用户、笔记、向量搜索) rather than technical terms
- Focuses on user value and workflows
- All mandatory sections are complete and detailed

### Requirement Completeness Check ✅

**Status**: PASSED

All requirements are clear and testable:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all edge cases have reasonable defaults documented)
- Each FR has clear expected behavior
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentage, count)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "保存操作在 500 毫秒内完成" instead of "SQLite write completes in 500ms")
- All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases identified with clear handling strategies
- Scope is bounded with comprehensive Out of Scope section
- Assumptions and dependencies clearly documented

### Feature Readiness Check ✅

**Status**: PASSED

The feature is well-defined and ready for planning:
- 18 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 4 prioritized user stories covering all primary flows (P1: CRUD, P2: RAG, P3: Organization, P2: Chat Integration)
- 10 measurable success criteria aligned with user value
- No implementation leakage detected

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All quality checks passed:
- Content is business-focused and non-technical
- Requirements are testable and measurable
- User scenarios are independently testable and prioritized
- Edge cases and assumptions are documented
- Scope is clearly bounded

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional, if clarification needed)
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
