# Specification Quality Checklist: 市场商店分享功能

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Analysis

- ✅ The spec is written entirely in user-centric language (Chinese) focusing on what users can do
- ✅ No mention of specific technologies like React, Hono, Drizzle - only mentions TanStack Query in caching requirements which is acceptable as it's already in use
- ✅ All sections describe business value and user workflows
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Analysis

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clearly defined
- ✅ All 37 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-037) are testable and specific
- ✅ Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-023) are all measurable with concrete metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - focus on user experience (e.g., "3 clicks", "500ms", "100% data integrity")
- ✅ Six user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- ✅ Ten edge cases identified covering concurrency, data integrity, performance, and error scenarios
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded - explicitly excludes Local LLMs and Cloud LLMs modules for future work
- ✅ Dependencies on existing ChatConfig and KnowledgeBase structures are documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ Each of the 37 functional requirements maps to specific user stories and success criteria
- ✅ User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with independent test descriptions
- ✅ Success criteria organized by category (Sharing, Installation, Browsing, Data Consistency, Performance, UX)
- ✅ No technical implementation leaked - all requirements describe "what" not "how"

## Notes

The specification is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. The feature scope is well-defined with:
- 6 user stories prioritized from P1 to P3
- 37 functional requirements organized into 8 categories
- 23 measurable success criteria
- 10 edge cases for robust implementation

The spec maintains excellent separation between "what users need" (specification) and "how to build it" (implementation), which will be addressed in the planning phase.
