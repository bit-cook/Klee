## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/signerlabs/klee.git
   cd klee
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/klee.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Set up environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` files and configure
   - See [README.md](README.md#environment-configuration) for details

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming convention:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 3. Run Tests

Before submitting, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
npm run test           # Run all tests
npm run build          # Verify build works
npm run lint           # Check code style
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

See [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines) below.

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

- Go to the original repository on GitHub
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your fork and branch
- Fill in the PR template
- Submit!

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow TanStack Query patterns (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md))
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

### File Organization

```
client/src/renderer/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # React components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature/       # Grouped by feature
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom hooks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature/       # Grouped by feature
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ queries/   # TanStack Query hooks
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ mutations/ # TanStack Mutation hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/            # TanStack Router routes
â””â”€â”€ lib/               # Utilities
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.tsx`, `kebab-case.ts`
- **Components**: `PascalCase`
- **Hooks**: `useCamelCase`
- **Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Types/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`

## Architecture Guidelines

### TanStack Query Patterns

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#tanstack-query-usage) for detailed patterns.

**Key Points**:
- Query hooks for read operations (`hooks/*/queries/`)
- Mutation hooks for write operations (`hooks/*/mutations/`)
- Proper cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### Hono RPC

- All API routes in `server/src/routes/`
- Use Zod validators for inputs
- Type inference flows automatically to client
- No manual type definitions needed

### Electron IPC

- IPC handlers in `client/src/main/ipc/`
- Type-safe with proper interfaces
- Document all channels
- Handle errors gracefully
